  <h1>Draggable</h1>
  <p> Not gonna lie professor, I have the brain of a pea, and need some help figuring out how to work with this JS library because it has one element that is the drag and drop, and I cannot, for the life of me, figure it out. I'll be asking for some
    kind of assistance during lab time. Thank you for understanding.</p>

  <div class="draggable"> Draggable Element </div>

  <h1> Drag and Drop Zone </h1>
  <p>again...I got the basics of the code, but doesn't seem to want to work with me</p>
  <div id="no-drop" class="drag-drop"> #no-drop </div>

<div id="yes-drop" class="drag-drop"> #yes-drop </div>

<div id="outer-dropzone" class="dropzone">
  #outer-dropzone
  <div id="inner-dropzone" class="dropzone">#inner-dropzone</div>
 </div>
